        Returns a path of maximal cost (total weight), and that cost. The graph
        must be acyclic. Single-vertex "paths" are considered. (Another way to
        think of this as finding the "diameter" of a vertex-weighted DAG.) This
        takes O(n + m) on a graph of n vertices and m edges.

        This is similar to the linear-time algorithm for finding single-source
        shortest paths in a weighted (i.e., edge-weighted) DAG: it first finds
        a topological sort of the vertices, then performs relaxations in that
        order. There are three significant differences:

        (1) We are finding a path of maximum, not minimum, cost (total weight).

        (2) The weights are on the vertices, not the edges. For each vertex v,
            best-cost-so-far(v) starts at weight(v). To relax an edge (u, v) is
            to update best-cost-so-far(v) to best-cost(u) + weight(v) if the
            latter is greater (and update v's predecessor/parent accordingly).

        (3) We are maximizing cost and all weights are positive, so any optimal
            path begins at a root. We find all roots' optimal paths in linear
            time (and the result is some optimal choice of those). It is as if
            we inserted a new root of weight 0 with edges to all the old roots.

    A collection of possibly overlapping positive-length weighted intervals.

    This data structure solves the weighted interval scheduling problem in
    quadratic time. This is faster than the exponential-time brute-force
    algorithm, but slower than an O(n log n) dynamic programming algorithm
    given by Jon Kleinberg and Ã‰va Tardos (*Algorithm Design*, pp. 252-260,
    pub. 2006).

    The quadratic algorithm implemented here first builds a vertex-weighted
    directed acyclic graph whose vertices are intervals. The edge (u, v) is in
    the graph iff u finishes no later than v starts. For n intervals, there are
    up to n(n - 1) such edges, so this takes O(n**2) time. That takes place
    incrementally as the user repeatedly calls add().

    Then, the graph is topologically sorted and a path that maximizes total
    weight is found. These operations are each linear in the size (number of
    edges) of the graph. Finding a max-cost path -- which can also be regarded
    as finding the "diameter" of the graph -- is similar to finding shortest
    paths in a DAG. See IntGraph.compute_max_cost_path() for how this is done.
    There are O(n**2) edges for n intervals, so this also takes O(n**2) time.
    This happens when the user calls compute_max_cost_nonoverlapping_subset().

    See ALGORITHM.md for a more detailed description of this algorithm, and its
    conceptual connection to the faster algorithm by Kleinberg and Tardos.
